# Music Playlist Hub

## Description

### What was your motivation?
- Our motivation for creating Music Playlist Hub stemmed from a shared passion for music and a desire to enhance the music discovery experience for users. 

### Why did you build this project?
- We built Music Playlist Hub to address the challenges and inefficiencies inherent in the current music discovery process. As avid music enthusiasts ourselves, we experienced firsthand the frustration of navigating multiple platforms to find curated playlists and information about upcoming music events.

### What problem does it solve?
- By consolidating music playlists from various sources and integrating ticketing information for concerts and festivals, Music Playlist Hub offers users a centralized destination for all their music-related needs.

### What did you learn?
-  We gained experience in integrating external APIs, such as the Spotify API and ticketing APIs, to access and display music playlists and concert information within the platform.
